こんにちは TAG-さん!

I'm requesting a TAG review of [feature name].

[One paragraph summary of idea, ideally copy-pasted from Explainer introduction]

  - Explainer¹ (minimally containing user needs and example code): [url]
  - Specification URL: [spec url]
  - Tests: [wpt folder(s), if available]
  - User research: [url to public summary/results of research]
  - Security and Privacy self-review²: [url]
  - GitHub repo: [url]
  - Primary contacts (and their relationship to the specification):
      - [name] ([github username]), [organization/s] (repeat as necessary, we recommend including group chairs and editors in this list)
  - Organization(s)/project(s) driving the specification: [organization and/or project name]
  - Key pieces of existing multi-stakeholder (e.g. developers, implementers, civil society) support, review or discussion of this specification
  - Key pieces of multi-implementer support:
    - Chromium comments: [url]
    - Mozilla comments: https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/NNN
    - WebKit comments: https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/NNN
    - etc...
  - External status/issue trackers for this specification (publicly visible, e.g. Chrome Status):

Further details:

  - [ ] I have reviewed the TAG's [Web Platform Design Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/)
  - Relevant time constraints or deadlines: [please provide]
  - The group where the work on this specification is currently being done:
  - The group where standardization of this work is intended to be done (if current group is a community group or other incubation venue):
  - Major unresolved issues with or opposition to this specification:
  - This work is being funded by:

You should also know that...

[please tell us anything you think is relevant to this review]

CAREFULLY READ AND DELETE CONTENT BELOW THIS LINE BEFORE SUBMITTING

Please preview the issue and check that the links work before submitting.

In particular, if anything links to a URL which requires authentication (e.g. Google document), please make sure anyone with the link can access the document. We would prefer fully public documents though, since we work in the open.

¹ We require an explainer to give the relevant context for the spec review, even if the spec has some background information. For background, see our [explanation of how to write a good explainer](https://tag.w3.org/explainers/). We recommend the explainer to be in [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

² A Security and Privacy questionnaire helps us understand potential security and privacy issues and mitigations for your design, and can save us asking redundant questions. See https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/.

³ For your own organization, you can simply state the organization's position instead of linking to it. Chromium doesn't have a standards-positions repository and [prefers](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:docs/standards/positions/GoogleChrome/README.md) to use comments from the teams that maintain the relevant area of their codebase.
